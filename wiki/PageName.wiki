#summary What we envision wootQuery to be able to do

= Syntax =

Although we are modeling after jQuery, this is our own language so we can probably take some liberties. To invoke wootQuery, we will have the following syntax:

{{{
woot(element).method1(arg);
}}}

Of course, longer call chains are also possible:

{{{
woot(element).method1(arg).method2(arg);
}}}

= Example Code =

Out of the many functions of jQuery, the following 3 likely provide the most useful basic functionality:

Selection:
{{{
woot("#idname");
woot(".classname");
woot("elementname");
}}}

Manipulation:
{{{
woot("a").replaceWith("<b>This is no longer a link!</b>");
woot("p").html("Hello there!");
}}}

CSS:
{{{
woot("b").addClass("highlight");
}}}


If time permits, we can work on other functionality.
